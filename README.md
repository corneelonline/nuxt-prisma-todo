## Build Setup

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [documentation](https://nuxtjs.org).

## Add Prisma to the app

Now that your Nuxt application is running, the next step is to set up Prisma. Youâ€™ll first install the Prisma CLI as a dev dependency by running the following command:

```
yarn add prisma --dev
```

Once the installation is complete, run the following command:

```
yarn prisma init
```

The command above creates a folder called `prisma` at the root of your project which contains a file called `schema.prisma` and a `.env` file at the root of the project. The `schema.prisma` defines your database connection and Prisma Client generator.
